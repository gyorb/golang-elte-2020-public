# Glide example

1, Install glide https://glide.sh/

2, Init it in your project root

```
$ glide init
```

3, Add import to your files and run install/update or add your deps into the vendor before usage (This way you'll have code completion in your IDE from the start!):

```
$ glide get github.com/google/uuid
```
