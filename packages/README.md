# Packages

In the past there was nothing else, just GOPATH manipulation and `go get`.
And people find a way with generated package renaming like: `https://gopkg.in/yaml.v2`

In `1.5` we got the vendor folder then a lot of tooling around it, for example [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide).
[Example](glide/README.md)

Later in `1.9` we got the official version called [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep).
[Example](dep/README.md)

Finally in `1.11` they introduced the [modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules).
[Example](module/README.md)
